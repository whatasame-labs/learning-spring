# Learning Spring

Welcome to the journey of learning Spring framework through Test-Driven Development (TDD). This repository is
designed for self-paced exploration, allowing me to deepen my understanding of Spring framework concepts through
hands-on coding and testing.

## Introduction

This repository is organized into a series of modules representing a dependency in Spring framework. Each module
consists of a set of tests that demonstrate the usage of the dependency.

### Spring Core

- [AOP](spring-core/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/aop): How works Spring AOP and how to use it.
- [Bean naming](spring-core/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/beannaming): How to name and specifiy a bean between
  multiple beans.
- [Properties](spring-core/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/properties): How to bind external properties to a bean.

### Spring Web

- [ThymeLeaf](spring-web/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/thymeleaf): Why use ThymeLeaf instead of JSP and how to use
  it in Spring MVC.

- [WebClient](spring-web/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/webclient): How to use WebClient and test with mock server.

### Spring Data JPA

- [Persistence context](spring-data-jpa/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/persistencecontext): What is persistence
  context and how does it work in different type of.

### Spring library

- [Testcontainers](spring-library/src/test/java/com/github/whatasame/testconatiners): How to
